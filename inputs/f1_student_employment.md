# F-1 Student Employment Guidelines

## Overview
F-1 students in the United States are subject to specific employment regulations that govern their ability to work while maintaining their student status.

## On-Campus Employment
F-1 students may work on-campus up to 20 hours per week during the academic term and full-time during vacation periods. On-campus employment includes:
- Work at the school where the student is enrolled
- Work for on-campus commercial firms that provide services to students
- Work performed off-campus at an educationally affiliated location

## Curricular Practical Training (CPT)
CPT is temporary employment authorization that is directly related to the student's major area of study. Key points:
- Must be an integral part of the curriculum
- Requires enrollment in a course that awards academic credit
- Available for both part-time (20 hours or less) and full-time work
- Must receive authorization before beginning employment

## Optional Practical Training (OPT)
OPT allows F-1 students to work in their field of study for up to 12 months. Additional considerations:
- Pre-completion OPT: Can be used before graduation (part-time during school, full-time during breaks)
- Post-completion OPT: Full-time employment after graduation
- STEM OPT Extension: Additional 24 months for qualifying STEM degree holders
- Requires EAD (Employment Authorization Document) from USCIS

## Remote Work Considerations
Remote work for F-1 students involves complex considerations:
- **Location matters**: Student must maintain physical presence in the US
- **Employer location**: US-based employers generally required for CPT/OPT
- **Tax implications**: Working for foreign employers may have tax consequences
- **Visa compliance**: Must maintain full-time enrollment and not violate status

## Unauthorized Employment
Working without proper authorization can result in:
- Termination of F-1 status
- Denial of future immigration benefits
- Removal from the United States
- Bar from re-entry

## Best Practices
1. Always consult with your Designated School Official (DSO) before accepting employment
2. Maintain proper documentation of all employment authorization
3. Understand the difference between various work authorization types
4. Keep track of employment dates and hours worked
5. File taxes appropriately for all income earned
